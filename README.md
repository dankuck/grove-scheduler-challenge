A solution to the <a href="https://github.com/groveco/grove-scheduler-challenge
">Grove Scheduler Challenge</a> from Grove Collaborative

# Running the Scheduler

You can run the scheduler by visiting <a href="https://dankuck.github.io/grove-scheduler-challenge/">https://dankuck.github.io/grove-scheduler-challenge/</a>.

# Installation

If you'd like to install this yourself instead of using the live version above, you can follow these steps:

* Checkout this repository
* `npm install`
* `gulp`
* Navigate a browser to the `index.html` file.

# Notes

I used the `cron-parser` library available on npm. I felt it was well within the spirit of the challenge to use third-party libraries useful to the task.
