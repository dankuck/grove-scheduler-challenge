# Installation

If you'd like to install this yourself instead of using the supplied compiled version, you can follow these steps:

* Checkout this repository
* `npm install`
* `gulp`
* Navigate a browser to the `index.html` file.

# Notes

I used the cron-parser library available on npm. I felt it was well within the spirit of the challenge to use third-party libraries useful to the task.
